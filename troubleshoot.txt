# Common Issues and Fixes for Escalibur Exploitation Framework

1. **Permission Denied Error**: Users may encounter permission denied errors when attempting to execute certain commands, especially those that require elevated privileges.
   - **Fix**: Run the framework with elevated privileges using `sudo python3 post_exploitation_framework.py`.

2. **File Not Found Error**: Users may receive file not found errors when attempting to list files or view exploit information if the required files (`exploits.txt`, etc.) are missing.
   - **Fix**: Ensure that all required files are present in the project directory and are correctly named.

3. **Dependency Installation**: If the user is missing dependencies required by the framework, they may encounter import errors or other issues.
   - **Fix**: Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

4. **Syntax Errors**: Users may encounter syntax errors if they attempt to run the framework with incompatible versions of Python or if there are syntax errors in the code.
   - **Fix**: Ensure that the framework is being run with a compatible version of Python (Python 3.x) and check for any syntax errors in the code.

5. **Invalid Command Errors**: Users may receive "invalid command" errors if they mistype commands or use commands that are not supported by the framework.
   - **Fix**: Review the list of available commands using the `help` command and ensure that the correct syntax is used when entering commands.

6. **Crashes or Freezes**: The framework may crash or freeze due to bugs or errors in the code.
   - **Fix**: Report any bugs or issues to the project maintainers on GitHub and try running the framework again after updating to the latest version.

7. **Incorrect Output**: Users may receive unexpected or incorrect output when executing certain commands.
   - **Fix**: Double-check the command syntax and ensure that the inputs are correct. If the issue persists, review the code for any bugs or errors.

8. **Security Concerns**: Users may have security concerns when using the framework in sensitive environments, especially if it interacts with live systems.
   - **Fix**: Exercise caution and use the framework responsibly in controlled environments. Avoid using it in production systems or networks without proper authorization.

9. **Compatibility Issues**: The framework may not be compatible with certain operating systems, Python versions, or system configurations.
   - **Fix**: Check the documentation and system requirements for the framework to ensure compatibility with the user's environment. Consider making adjustments or modifications as needed.

10. **Documentation**: Users may encounter difficulties understanding how to use certain features or commands due to insufficient documentation.
    - **Fix**: Improve the documentation by adding more detailed explanations, examples, and usage instructions. Encourage users to provide feedback and suggestions for improvement.
